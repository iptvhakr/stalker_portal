                            The ionCube Loader 
                            ------------------

This package contains:

* ionCube Loaders

* a Loader Wizard script to assist with Loader installation (loader-wizard.php)

* the License document for use of the Loader and encoded files (LICENSE.txt)

* User Guide (new with Loader 5). The Loader operates as an extension to
  PHP, and has options that can be configured through the php.ini file. 
  There are options that may improve performance, particularly with files on
  a network drive. Options that relate to the free ionCube24 Intrusion
  Protection service (ioncube24.com) are also described.
